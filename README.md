To whom it may concern,


My name is Abhishek Deorukhkar, I am a front-end/fullstack software engineer and Aspiring professional football (soccer) player.
I am currently pursuing a Computer Science Degree at The Lassonde School of Engineering @ York University.
I am very passionate about Soccer, Space, and I am a life long Arsenal fan!
Recently, I have been getting into various hobbies in my downtime such as Sim Racing, video games, learning about Quantum Mechanics and Linear Algebra, 
as well as basic Machine learning.
I find continuing to expand my knowledge in various topics regarding Math, Science and Automotive engineering essential to my growth as a software engineer.

I am currently trying to build my github page by adding various projects I had created from 2018-present.
Although I have been coding since 2015 I never took it seriously/ never had a profound passion until 2018.

My plans are to work as a software engineer or a pro football (soccer) player in no order.
I am always learning new methods and ways to increase my knowledge and skillset and I am open for collaboration as well as criticism and lessons on how I can improve as a developer.

Currently I would like to collaborate in 3 streams; Automotive engineering, Big data visualization, and finally Artificial Intelligence.

I am most active on my linkedin page as well as my personal twitter. I prefer you conduct business on my linkedin and personal inquiries on my twitter.
I am in the process of publishing my own portfolio website soon, This is something I am quite proud of and can not wait to share with you!
